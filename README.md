# CPSC 310 - insightUBC
UBC is a big place, and involves a large number of people doing a variety of tasks. The goal of this project was to provide a way to perform some of the tasks required to run the university and to enable effective querying of the metadata from around campus. 
This involve: working with courses, prerequisites, past course averages, room scheduling, and timetable creation. 
The Project is a representation of'full stack' web development project using Node. TypeScript/JavaScript, front-end development tools were used (HTML, CSS and jQuery). 
Lots of database querrying was used.
